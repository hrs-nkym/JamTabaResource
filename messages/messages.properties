Section.Needs.title=What I need to play?
Section.Needs.text1=You can play/sing <b>using the built-in microphone </b> from your computer (most laptops today come equipped with these microphones). If using the built-in microphone of your notebook also use the headphones for not having <b> feedback problems.</b>
Section.Needs.text2=You can also plug in your guitar, bass or keyboard in <b> line input </b> from your computer. Generally this entry is very close to the connector for the headphones. In this case you will probably need a plug adapter.
Section.Needs.text3=Additionally, you can also use an <b> audio interface </b> with Jamtaba for high quality sound.

Section.Important.title=Important!
Section.Important.text=Whenever possible use a cable <b> network </b> when using the <b> Jamtaba</b>. Using the network cable instead of wireless <b> </b> you should be able to play with less delay and with superior sound quality. Using a cable network <b> </b> the experience of playing online with musicians who are closest to you can be very similar to "play live".

Section.Problems.title=Port Forwarding!
Section.Problems.text1=To play with other musicians in Jamtaba computers need communicate. This may not be possible in some cases due to the configuration of your network or the networks of other musicians. When there is a problem in your network settings you enter a room in the Jamtaba to play with other musicians and can not hear their sounds.
Section.Problems.solution=The Solution
Section.Problems.text2=You need to configure your modem/router to allow your computer to communicate with the computers of the other musicians. The first and easy way is enable <b>UpNp</b> in your network device. If UpNp don't work you need to do a procedure known as <b>Port Forwading </b>. You must open the door <b> 30.000 </b> for the <b>UDP protocol </b>.
Section.Problems.text3=In each modem/router this configuration is done differently, so it is not possible to provide a general explanation for these procedures.

Section.Contact.text=Send suggestions and ideas for <b> elieserdejesus@gmail.com </b>. Below you can see the list of improvements that are planned for <b>Jamtaba</b>:

Section.LocalLatency.title=I'm listening my sound with a little delay. How to solve?
Section.LocalLatency.text=On the Jamtaba <b> menu </b> There is an option to <b> configure audio</b>. Use this option and try changing the <b>buffer size</b> to <b>128</b>.

Section.NetworkLatency.title=Can I play with musicians from anywhere?
Section.NetworkLatency.text=Unfortunately not! The further away you are the other musicians will be more delay in the sound, making it difficult to musical performance. In practice, you can play comfortably (without delays) with musicians who are closest to you. The amount of delay can also vary depending on the speed of your internet connection. The <b> Jamtaba </b> has an option to show you only the rooms with musicians who are closest to you, minimizing the problems of delay in the sound.
